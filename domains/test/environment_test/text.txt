=== ZAAI Environment Test - Plain Text File ===

ZAAI Environment Test - Plain Text File

This plain text file serves as a comprehensive test artifact for validating
the ZAAI system's ability to process, parse, and understand plain text files
in various formats and encodings. It demonstrates text processing capabilities
while following AI-first documentation principles established in the ZAAI codebase.

Architecture Purpose:
This file is referenced by the test domain (domains/test/test.yaml) as part 
of the environment validation benchmark. It validates the system's capability 
to handle plain text files with various content types, formatting elements,
and character encodings in the workspace environment.

Cross-file Dependencies:
- Referenced by: domains/test/test.yaml (env benchmark)
- Used by: Environment test functions that validate text file processing
- Part of: Multi-format file validation test suite

Text Processing Features Demonstrated:
- UTF-8 encoding with various character types
- Multi-line text structure and formatting
- Mixed content types (text, numbers, URLs, email addresses)
- Special characters and symbols
- Structured lists and enumerated content
- Lorem ipsum placeholder text for testing
- File metadata and descriptive information

AI Comprehension Notes:
This file contains representative plain text content that an AI system should
be able to read, analyze, and understand. It includes various text patterns,
formatting styles, and content structures typical in text file processing.

It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate:
- Line counting functionality
- Word counting features  
- Character counting capabilities
- Search functionality within text content

The file includes various formatting elements:
• Bullet points
• Numbers: 123, 456, 789
• Special characters: @#$%^&*()
• URLs: https://example.com
• Email addresses: test@example.com

This text file can be used to verify that the text file handler:
1. Correctly reads and displays content
2. Provides accurate statistics (lines, words, characters)
3. Supports text search operations
4. Handles various text formats properly
5. Maintains content integrity during operations
