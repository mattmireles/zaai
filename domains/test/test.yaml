# ZAAI Test Domain Benchmarks
#
# This file defines benchmarks for testing environment capabilities and file format
# handling. These benchmarks validate that the ZAAI system can properly process
# various file types and media formats that may be encountered in real-world
# development scenarios.
#
# File Format Categories:
# - Documents: PDF files for document processing and text extraction
# - Images: JPEG, JPG, PNG formats for image handling and processing
# - Vector Graphics: SVG files for scalable graphics processing  
# - Source Code: Multiple programming languages (C, C++, Go, Python, etc.)
# - Text Files: Plain text processing and content extraction
#
# Testing Philosophy:
# These benchmarks focus on the system's ability to load, parse, and understand
# different file formats rather than implementing complex functionality.
# They serve as integration tests for the file handling capabilities of the
# ZAAI environment.
#
# Workspace Integration:
# All test files are referenced from the workspace using the references section,
# demonstrating the system's ability to map external files into the execution
# environment with proper path resolution.
#
# Cross-file Dependencies:
# - Inherits common configurations from ../suite.yaml  
# - References files from domains/test/environment_test/ directory
# - Validates the workspace file mapping and access system

# Environment File Handler Testing Benchmark
#
# Tests the system's capability to handle various file formats and media types.
# This benchmark validates that the ZAAI environment can properly load, access,
# and process different file formats that might be referenced in real benchmarks.
